## Reporting a Security Issue

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it through the
[Security Advisories](https://github.com/remeda/remeda/security/advisories/new)
page.

We take security seriously and will respond to valid reports promptly.

## Responsible Disclosure

Please avoid publicly disclosing vulnerabilities before they've been addressed.
This allows time to assess the issue and release a fix before users are put at
risk.

## What Makes a Good Report

A good security report includes:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- A minimal, working proof-of-concept demonstrating the issue
- The impact and potential attack scenarios
