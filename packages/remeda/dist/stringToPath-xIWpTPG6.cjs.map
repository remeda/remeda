This type allows us\n * to return fine-grained types and to enforce correctness at the type-level.\n *\n * We **discourage** using this utility for new code. This utility is for legacy\n * code that already contains path strings (which are accepted by Lodash). We\n * strongly recommend using *path arrays* instead as they provide better\n * developer experience via significantly faster type-checking, fine-grained\n * error messages, and automatic typeahead suggestions for each segment of the\n * path.\n *\n * *There are a bunch of limitations to this utility derived from the\n * limitations of the type itself, these are usually edge-cases around deeply\n * nested paths, escaping, whitespaces, and empty segments. This is true even\n * in cases where the runtime implementation can better handle them, this is\n * intentional.
