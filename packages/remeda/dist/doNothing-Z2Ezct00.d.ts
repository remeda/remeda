//#region src/doNothing.d.ts
/**
 * A function that takes any arguments and does nothing with them. This is
 * useful as a placeholder for any function or API that requires a **void**
 * function (a function that doesn't return a value). This could also be used in
 * combination with a ternary or other conditional execution to allow disabling
 * a function call for a specific case.
 *
 * Notice that this is a dataLast impl where the function needs to be invoked
 * to get the "do nothing" function.
 *
 * See also:
 * * `constant` - A function that ignores it's arguments and returns the same value on every invocation.
 * * `identity` - A function that returns the first argument it receives.
 *
 * @signature
 *   R.doNothing();
 * @example
 *   myApi({ onSuccess: handleSuccess, onError: R.doNothing() });
 *   myApi({ onSuccess: isDemoMode ? R.doNothing(): handleSuccess });
 * @dataLast
 * @category Function
