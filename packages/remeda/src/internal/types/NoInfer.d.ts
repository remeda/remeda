// TODO [>2]: We polyfill `NoInfer` which was introduced into the language in TypeScript 5.4 for versions we support prior to that (5.1-5.3). The definition was copied from `type-fest` version 4.x.x where it was defined for the same reasons but that starting from version 5.x.x bumped the minimum TypeScript version to 5.4 which and migrated types to the native `NoInfer`. To allow us to use the latest version of type-fest while still supporting our minimum TypeScript version we need to "inject" it into the global namespace via this .d.ts file so it looks like it's available natively too.
type NoInfer<T> = T extends infer U ? U : never;
