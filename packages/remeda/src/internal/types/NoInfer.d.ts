// TODO [>2]: We polyfill `NoInfer` which was introduced into the language in TypeScript 5.4 for versions we support prior to that (5.1-5.3). The definition was copied from `type-fest` v4 where it was defined for the same reasons; but starting v5 the minimum TypeScript version was bumped to 5.4 which meant types starting using `NoInfer` natively. To allow us to use the latest version of type-fest while still supporting our minimum TypeScript version we need to "inject" it into the global namespace via this .d.ts file so it looks like it's available natively too.
type NoInfer<T> = T extends infer U ? U : never;
