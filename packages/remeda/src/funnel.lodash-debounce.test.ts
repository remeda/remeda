/**
 * A reference implementation of the Lodash `debounce` function using the
 * Remeda `funnel` function. While migrating from Lodash you can copy this
 * function as-is into your code base and use it as a drop-in replacement; but
 * we recommend eventually inlining the call to `funnel` so you can adjust the
 * function to your specific needs.
 *
 * This is a simplified implementation which ignores the Lodash capability to
 * track the return value of the callback function, but it is most likely the
 * more common use-case. For a more complete (and more complex) implementation
 * that also handles that requirement see the reference implementation for
 * `debounceWithCachedValue` in the other test file.
 *
 * The following tests in this file are based on the Lodash tests for debounce.
 * They have been adapted to work with our testing framework, have been fixed
 * or expanded slightly were it felt necessary, and have been modernized for
 * better readability. The names of the test cases have been preserved to ease
 * comparing them to the original tests.
 *
 * Note that this means that whenever Lodash offered a concrete spec, we made
 * sure our reference implementation respects it, but there might be untested
 * use-cases that would have differing runtime behaviors.
 *
 * @see Lodash Documentation: https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#debounce
