/**
 * This should only be used for defining generics which extend any kind of JS
 * array under the hood, this includes arrays *AND* tuples (of the form [x, y],
 * and of the form [x, ...y[]], etc...), and their readonly equivalent. This
 * allows us to be more inclusive to what functions can process.
 *
 * @example
 *   function map<T extends IterableContainer>(items: T) { ... }
 *
 * We would've named this `ArrayLike`, but that's already used by typescript...
 * @see This was inspired by the type-definition of Promise.all (https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/1df5717b120cddd325deab8b0f2b2c3eecaf2b01/src/lib/es2015.promise.d.ts#L21)
