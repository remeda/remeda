/**
 * The result of running a function that would dedupe an array (`unique`,
 * `uniqueBy`, and `uniqueWith`).
 *
 * There are certain traits of the output which are unique to a deduped array
 * that allow us to create a better type; see comments inline.
 *
 * !Note: We can build better types for each of the unique functions
 * _separately_ by taking advantage of _other_ characteristics that are unique
 * to each one (e.g. in `unique` we know that each item that has a disjoint type
 * to all previous items would be part of the output, even when it isn't the
 * first), but to make this utility the most useful we kept it simple and
 * generic for now.
