/**
 * A reference implementation of the Lodash `debounce` function using the
 * Remeda `funnel` function. While migrating from Lodash you can copy this
 * function as-is into your codebase and use it as a drop-in replacement; but
 * we recommend eventually inlining the call to `funnel` so you can adjust the
 * function to your specific needs.
 *
 * This is a more complex implementation which respects Lodash capability to
 * track the return value of the callback function. In most cases you are more
 * likely to prefer the simpler reference implementation `debounce` which can
 * be found in the other test file.
 *
 * The following tests in this file are based on the Lodash tests for debounce.
 * They have been adapted to work with our testing framework, have been fixed
 * or expanded slightly were it felt necessary, and have been modernized for
 * better readability. The names of the test cases have been preserved to ease
 * comparing them to the original tests. Tests that are unrelated to the cache
 * capability have been removed to avoid duplication with the other test file.
 *
 * Note that this means that whenever Lodash offered a concrete spec, we made
 * sure our reference implementation respects it, but there might be untested
 * use-cases that would have differing runtime behaviors.
 *
