/**
 * Executes a transformer function based on the first matching predicate,

 * corresponding transformer, and returns, ignoring any further cases, even if
 * they would match.
 *
 * For simpler cases you should also consider using `when` instead.
 *
 * !IMPORTANT! - Unlike similar implementations in frameworks like Lodash and
 * Ramda, the Remeda implementation does **NOT** return a default/fallback
 * `undefined` value when none of the cases match; and instead will **throw** an
 * exception in those cases.
 * To add a default case use the `conditional.defaultCase` helper as the final
 * case of your implementation. By default it returns `undefined`, but could be
 * provided a transformer in order to return something else.
 *
 * Due to TypeScript's inability to infer the result of negating a type-
 * predicate we can't refine the types used in subsequent cases based on
 * previous conditions. Using a `switch (true)` statement or ternary operators
 * is recommended for more precise type control when such type narrowing is
 * needed.
 *
 * @param cases - A list of (up to 10) tuples, each defining a case. Each tuple
 * consists of a predicate (or a type-predicate) and a transformer function that
 * processes the data if its case matches.
 * @returns The output of the matched transformer. If no cases match, an
 * exception is thrown. The return type is a union of the return types of all
