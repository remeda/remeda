   * A binary search implementation that finds the index at which `predicate`
   * stops returning `true` and starts returning `false` (consistently) when run
   * on the items of the array. It **assumes** that mapping the array via the
   * predicate results in the shape `[...true[], ...false[]]`. *For any other case
   * the result is unpredictable.*
   *
   * This is the base implementation of the `sortedIndex` functions which define
   * the predicate for the user, for common use-cases.
   *
   * It is similar to `findIndex`, but runs at O(logN), whereas the latter is
   * general purpose function which runs on any array and predicate, but runs at
   * O(N) time.
