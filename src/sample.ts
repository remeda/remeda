  // a full scan of the input array (via filtering).
  //
  // This allows us 2 optimizations that are the core of how this function
  // works:
  // 1. It is hard to generate a large number of unique indices, as the more
  // indices we generate the more likely we are to generate one that is already
  // in the set, which would require more iterations of the generation loop.
  // Capping our effective sampleSize at n/2 would put an upper limit to the
  // average number of iterations required (as a function of n).
  // 2. If sample size is small enough, we never need to actually iterate over
  // the full input array at all; instead we simply project the values we need
  // via random access into the array. This means that for sampleSize (K) less
  // than n/2, we run at O(klogk). For large sampleSize we need to iterate over
  // the full input array, but we don't need to sort the indices because we can
  // use the Set's 'has' method, so we effectively run at O(n).
