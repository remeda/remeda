 * * `indexBy` - Builds an object from an array of *values* and a mapper for keys.
 * * `pullObject` - Builds an object from an array of items with mappers for *both* keys and values.
 * * `fromEntries` - Builds an object from an array of key-value pairs.
 * * `mapToObj` - Builds an object from an array of items and a single mapper for key-value pairs.
 * Refer to the docs for more details.

 * @param data - An array of keys of the output object. All items in the array
 * would be keys in the output array.
 * @param mapper - Takes a key and returns the value that would be associated
