<details><summary>We use semantic PR titles to automate the release process!</summary>

https://conventionalcommits.org

PRs should be titled following using the format: `< TYPE >(< scope >)?: description`

### Available Types:

- `feat`: new functions, and changes to a function's type that would impact users.
- `fix`: changes to the runtime behavior of an existing function, or refinements to it's type that shouldn't impact most users.
- `test`: tests-only changes (transparent to users of the function).
- `docs`: changes to the documentation of a function **or the documentation site**.
- `build`, `ci`, `chore`, and `revert`: are only relevant for the internals of the library.

For scope put the name of the function you are working on (either new or
existing).
