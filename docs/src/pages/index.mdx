# Remeda

Fully written in TypeScript for powerful, type-safe, and functional utilities.

<InstallCommands />

## ðŸ§° Useful

Remeda offers a wide range of common everyday utility functions so that you
don't have to deal with the minutiae of writing them yourself. We ensure that
our algorithms are efficient, optimized, and cover all edge cases properly. We
offer a wide range of functions, from simple utilities like
[`partition`](/docs#partition) and building objects with
[`pullObject`](/docs#pullObject), to complex algorithms like
[`takeFirstBy`](/docs#takeFirstBy).

```ts
import * as R from "remeda";
// Or import the function directly:
// import { sortBy } from "remeda";

type User = {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  lastLogin: number;
};

declare const USERS: User[];

R.sortBy(
  USERS,
  [R.prop("lastLogin"), "desc"],
  R.prop("lastName"),
  R.prop("firstName"),
);
```

## ðŸ‘· Fully Typed

Libraries like Lodash and Ramda are written in JavaScript, with types added
later. Remeda, on the other hand, is fully written in TypeScript! This means
types are deeply integrated into the code, allowing us to shift the focus from
runtime errors to compile-time errors, so you catch errors in your IDE and CI,
not in your logs, **and not in production**.

We strive to provide the best possible real-life types for all functions, often
going beyond what is offered by the TypeScript library, so you don't need to use
other libraries like 'type-fest' and 'ts-reset' just to get the types you
expected.

```ts
const DATA = [1, 2, 3] as const;

const builtin = DATA.map((x) => x.toString());
//    ^? string[]

const withRemeda = R.map(DATA, (x) => x.toString());
//    ^? [string, string, string]
```

## ðŸ¦¾ Functional

Functional programming is beneficial, making code more readable. However, there
are situations where you don't need "pipes" and want to call just a single
function. In Remeda, **all** functions have automatic currying built-in. This
means the same imported function can be called either regularly (what we call
_data-first_) or with the first parameter, _data_, omitted (what we call
_data-last_). When a data-last invocation is detected, Remeda creates a curried
version of that function on-the-fly, with all other parameters bound to it. This
allows you to use the same function in both functional and imperative styles,
without additional imports. It also means you can gradually adopt a functional
style where it makes sense without compromising readability when it doesn't.

```ts
// Lodash
_.pick(obj, ["firstName", "lastName"]);

// Ramda
R.pick(["firstName", "lastName"], obj);

// In Remeda you get both!
R.pick(obj, ["firstName", "lastName"]); // data-first
R.pipe(obj, R.pick(["firstName", "lastName"])); // data-last
```

In the above example, the "data-first" approach is more natural and programmer-
friendly because when you type the second argument, you get auto-complete from
the IDE. It's not possible to get auto-complete in Ramda because the data
argument is not provided.

The "data-last" approach is helpful when writing data transformations, aka
pipes.

```ts
const DATA = [
  { name: "john", age: 20, gender: "m" },
  { name: "marry", age: 22, gender: "f" },
  { name: "samara", age: 24, gender: "f" },
  { name: "paula", age: 24, gender: "f" },
  { name: "bill", age: 33, gender: "m" },
];

// Remeda
R.pipe(
  DATA,
  R.filter((x) => x.gender === "f"),
  R.groupBy((x) => x.age),
);

// Ramda
R.pipe(
  R.filter((x) => x.gender === "f"),
  //              ^? ðŸ˜” 'x' is of type 'unknown'
  R.groupBy((x) => x.age),
  //                 ^? ðŸ˜” Property 'age' does not exist on type 'P'
)(DATA);

// Lodash
_(DATA)
  .filter((x) => x.gender === "f")
  .groupBy((x) => x.age)
  .value();

// lodash/fp
_.flow(
  _.filter((x) => x.gender === "f"),
  //              ^? ðŸ˜” 'x' is of type 'unknown'
  _.groupBy((x) => x.age),
  //               ^? ðŸ˜” 'x' is of type 'unknown'
)(DATA);
```

## ðŸ”§ Efficient

You might have noticed the [`pipe`](/docs#pipe) function in the above example.
The pipe function allows you to structure complex data transformations in the
order they will be computed, avoiding the need to name intermediate variables or
having confusingly deep nesting that needs to be read from the center outwards.

But the Remeda pipe function has an additional benefit. It automatically detects
Remeda functions that could be computed **lazily** and optimizes those parts of
the pipe without you having to do anything. This means that expensive
computations can be deferred until they are actually needed.

```ts
// Get first 3 unique values
const DATA = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6];

const result = R.pipe(
  DATA,
  R.map((x) => {
    console.log("iterate", x);
    return x;
  }),
  R.unique(),
  R.take(3),
); // => [1, 2, 3]

// Console output:
// iterate 1
// iterate 2
// iterate 2
// iterate 3
```

## ðŸ”¬ Trustworthy!

All this wouldn't be worth much if it didn't work. That's why Remeda has an
extensive test suite that offers 100% coverage. We also test all functions on
all supported Node versions to make sure we never regress. Our tests cover not
just runtime behavior but also types!

We use the strictest TypeScript settings and extensive linting to ensure that
nothing slips through the cracks.
